=================================================
sg73000/1 - FLUKA/FLAIR files and R script to get
particle spetra (in energy and LET!) at a number 
of positions for an SOBP (sg73000) and a single
peak (sg73001).
=================================================

Check validity of using FLUKA's LET output by
MGDRAW for fragments (which have ID HEAVYION
but differ from primary!).
